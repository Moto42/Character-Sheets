# Character-Sheets
A side project to make form-fillable, HTML versions of the various paperwork for some of the games I enjoy.

Most RPGs have some paperwork for keeping track of information, and most make electronic versions of these available to easily print out.
However these are almost always in .pdf format, and rarely include fillable fields to type the needed information into directly.

The goal here is to provide character sheets and other documents that are viewable, directly in the browser that resemble the original sheets from the books as closely as is possible, and will fit on an A4 sheet of paper when printed. (or multiple sheets, where applicable.)
